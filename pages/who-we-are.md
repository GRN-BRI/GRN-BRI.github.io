## Who we are

The Global Research Network Belt and Road Initiative (GRN-BRI) is an independent research network that provides a global platform for researchers to share, collaborate and partner on research projects in the field of logistics, transport, trade and supply chain.

## Vision

to be globally known research network to support an independent, transparent and evidence base research in logistics, transport and supply chain on the Belt and Road Initiative.

## Mission

To provide a global platform for supporting, sharing and partnering on BRI research to help researchers to generate and disseminate evidence to enhance logistics efficiency, trade facilitation and inter-institutional partnerships.

## What we do

The GRN-BRI enables and facilitates discussions on operational, strategic and developmental issues underpinning the Belt and Road Initiative at a global scale. We organise international conferences, industry seminars and training workshops to disseminate the latest research and strategic insights to enhance policy making and support economic development.

Our collaborative approach brings together an extensive network of experts and thought leaders from 50 countries in specialist fields to broaden their outreach to engage governments to generate meaningful impact through facilitating cross-border trade and infrastructure development along BRI trade corridors.
