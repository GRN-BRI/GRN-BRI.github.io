International Collaboration Network – Belt and Road Initiative (ICN – BRI, hereinafter called BRI Research Network or BRI Conference) was established at the first International Conference of One Belt and One Road hosted by RMIT University in Melbourne Australia on 30 November – 2 December 2016.

The BRI Research Network has generated opportunities for the researchers to publish their work in a series of Special Issues in high-ranked journals. The journals covered various BRI issues such as international logistics, supply chain management, international trade, aviation, and maritime transport and logistics.
