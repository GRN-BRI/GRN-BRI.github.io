In the complex and ever-changing international political and economic landscape, global industrial and supply chains are changing, while as a critical element of the global supply chain, maritime transportation and logistics are facing a series of new opportunities and challenges. Moreover, the China-Railway Express, which has played an important role in international trade transportation since the BRI in 2013, will also face some new situations in the Eurasian continent. At this moment, we welcome the 8th annual conference of The Global Research Network Belt - Road Initiative (GRN-BRI). The GRN-BRI having members from 60 institutes in 40 countries along the Belt and Road is an independent research network providing a global platform for researchers to share and collaborate on research projects in the field of logistics, transport, international trade, and supply chain (https://grn-bri.com/).
